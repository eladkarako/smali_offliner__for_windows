a Windows only, less generic but a lot faster implementation of my previous `smali_offliner`,  
basically `DIR` does the enumeration and file reading (and pattern-matching and editing) is parallel.  
console logs are limited to just the few files matching (instead of all of them).

usage:  

- `node.exe index.js "folder1" "folder2" "folder3" ....`  
- or `index.cmd "folder1" "folder2" "folder3" ....`
